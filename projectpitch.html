<p>I would like to explore and visualize data on mothers and childrens’ self-reported concerns related to being an undocumented immigrant and their relationship to health indicators, including sleep outcomes and maternal depression.</p>
<p>I have access to a dataset currently being analyzed by the Center for Environmental Research and Children’s Health at UC Berkeley. The principal investigator for the project is Professor Brenda Eskenazi. The post-doctoral scholar analyzing the data has said she can give me the files on Monday. So far, she has only provided some preliminary information on how study participants rated their level of worry about their immigration status and told me the health outcomes they will be studying in relationship to this exposure. I would also seek additional publicly available data on the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States and recent statistics on deportations and detentions to provide context and framing of the issue. </p>
<p>I wish to address these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proportion of study participants express being concerned about the threat to their family that is posed by their immigration status (composition)</li><li>The proportion of study participants who express concern about leaving their home for fear of being detained and/or deported (composition)</li><li>The relationship between these concerns and indicators of their physical and mental health</li><li>The implication of these type of prolonged stressors on long-term health outcomes</li></ul>
<p>I am envisioning using a map to show the location and numbers of undocumented immigrants in our country, circle charts to show the proporotion who express fear related to their immigration status, and bar charts to visualize the relationship between higher levels of stress/worry and lower levels of sleep/higher levels of depression.</p>
